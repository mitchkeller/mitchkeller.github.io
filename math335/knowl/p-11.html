<p>There are some things I will not expand on at all.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We will take most normal mathematical and logical terminology from a course such as MATH 210 <em class="emphasis">Transition to Abstract Mathematics</em> for granted.</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We assume that sets exist. We will take the sets of counting (\(\mathbb{N}\)), integer (\(\mathbb{Z}\)), rational (\(\mathbb{Q}\)), and real (\(\mathbb{R}\)) numbers as known. In this course \(\mathbb{N}\) starts with \(1\text{,}\) not \(0\text{.}\) We will denote the irrational numbers by \(\mathbb{Q}^{C}\text{,}\) a notation for the <em class="emphasis">complement</em> of the rationals with respect to the set \(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In these sets we will assume the most basic properties of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, such as commutativity and distributivity. Likewise, we will later assume without proof basic facts about ordering numbers. At this time we explicitly assume that \(0\lt 1\) and that there are no integers between them. You will be able to use these facts to <em class="emphasis">prove</em> that is true for other consecutive pairs of integers. (The fact \(0\lt 1\)Â <em class="emphasis">does</em> require proof! You may recall mention of the well-ordering principle from MATH 210, which his part of this.)</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We will assume the real numbers exist. (We will say more about their properties in a bit, though.)</p></li>
<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Although there is a lot of fun to be had with infinity, we do not foresee doing much with it other than using generic and specific infinite sets.</p></li>
