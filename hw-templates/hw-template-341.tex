\noindent\textbf{Collaboration statement}: This is where you put your
collaboration statement. Ensure that it makes specific reference to
this assignment's problems!

\begin{problem}{x} %You can use theorem, exercise, problem, or question here.  Modify x to be whatever number you are proving/solving
Delete this text and write the problem statement (or at least a
summary of it here. If the problem asks you to find a formula for
something and prove/explain it, restate the problem in a definitive
way that includes the formula/number you found, rather than as a
command of the form ``Find a formula\dots''. 
\end{problem}
 
\begin{proof}
Blah, blah, blah.  Here is an example of the \texttt{align} environment:
%Note 1: The * tells LaTeX not to number the lines.  If you remove the *, be sure to remove it below, too.
%Note 2: Inside the align environment, you do not want to use $-signs.  The reason for this is that this is already a math environment. This is why we have to include \text{} around any text inside the align environment.
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i & = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{k}i\right) +(k+1)\\ 
& = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}+k+1 & (\text{by inductive hypothesis})\\
& = \frac{k(k+1)+2(k+1)}{2}\\
& = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\\
& = \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
 
\begin{theorem}{x.yz}
Let \(n\in \Z\).  Then yada yada.
\end{theorem}
 
\begin{proof}[Solution] %Notice that this prints "Solution" instead of "Proof"
  See the code for how I made this say ``Solution''

\end{proof}
